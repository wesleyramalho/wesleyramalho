## Hi, I'm Wesley! üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
### 

I'm a software developer focused in **front-end technologies and web applications** (single-page applications with JS, HTML and CSS). I'm also learning more about back-end development, 
functional programming and relational/non-relational databases. I like to learn about data structures and 
algorithms. I'm not so good with math, but I'm also working on it. Maybe one day I'll learn more about AI.
